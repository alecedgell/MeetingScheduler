# MeetingScheduler

An application used to schedule and manage meetings for candidate interviews, built with React, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Project Status
This project has concluded team development for the course. Many features are not available because our dedicated server and database have been shutdown. Regardless, many features are still functioning.

To help with visualization, mock data has been hardcoded into where database queries would normally display. API calls have also been commented out.

## Reflection
  #### What was the context for this project?
  - The context for this project was to set out to create a meeting tracker that manages meetings for candidate interviews. 
    This software was to eventually be used to hire new professors at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire.
  ---
  #### What did you set out to build?
  - My team and I set out to build a product that was easy to use and be something that people enjoy using. We wanted to create as many features for the user to utilize without it becoming overwhelming. User experience was one of our primary goals.
  --- 
   #### Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - This project was a very good challenge for the whole team. It required all of us to step into something completely new and take responsibility for a large chunk of the project. Another huge challenge for the team was COVID-19.
    3 out of the 5 group members were a part of the study abroad program and were sent back home because of the pandemic. We struggled with communication and coordination initially
    because the respective time zones were completely opposite. After establishing a middle ground for meeting, we began to pick up significant pace.
  ---      
  #### What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - One prominent unexpected obstacle was our log in feature. We began development on the feature with a pretty good idea of how to implement it. We hit several road blocks during implementation, which delayed this feature until the end of the project. Another obstacle was that our database/server connectivity would hit some sort of cache limit, resulting in no data being displayed on the app. The only workaround we found was to manually clear the cache, which one person had access to.
  ---      
  #### What tools did you use to implement this project? 
  - The majority of the application was built using JavaScript, using CSS styling. Our IDE of choice was IntelliJ, because of its ability to communicate with seemingly any software you can think of. React (along with maven) was the front end's backbone, which was so nice to use. Our dedicated server was hosted using Digital Ocean and database was created and stored using MySQL.
